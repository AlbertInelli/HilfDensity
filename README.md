Hello!
This HilfDensity sheet is for the completion of the GeoTechnical test Hilf Density AS 1289.5.7.1 at Construction Sciences Oak Flats Laboratory.

To perform a test, fill in the information of the tester,tools used(Hammer and mould), preperation weight and rock mass, compactive effort and soil description to perform the test.

Before completing the test in the table you will have to enter the percent water and sub sample mass weight for a valid test and the program will give you the correct water to add to the soil subsample.

Once you have performed the test according to the Australian Standard, enter the weight of the mass of mould and soil and the program will automatically find the values, mass of soil only, wet density and converted wet density.

A valid test is minimum 3 points(Columns) at different water percentages to find optimum moisture content.

Note: This is a netbeans project and is best to open in netbeans.
